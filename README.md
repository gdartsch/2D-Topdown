# Simple 2D Topdown project for my portfolio

## Technologies used:

- Unity Engine for the client.
- Node.JS for the Server

### Unity Version: 2022.3.14 LTS

## Instructions:

1. Install the node modules by running `npm i` in the GameServer folder
2. Start the backend server with `npm start`
3. Open the Unity client. It will handle the login automatically

It works both from the Editor and Compiled game.

## Features I plan to add:

1. Splash screen.
2. Login system.
3. Different biomes.
4. Biome system.
